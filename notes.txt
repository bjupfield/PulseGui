okay this is the the three functions that are needed to establish a vao are

vertexArrayVertexBuffer
vertexAttribBinding
vertexAttribFormat

to query for vertex attributes locations we need
getProgramiv
getActiveAttrib
getAttribLocation
uniforms use instead
getActiveUniform
getUniformLocation

will be using an alignment method so instead of having 30 different vaos for the same program with different objects 
there can only be 1 vao for the same program with different objects, this will obviously make the memory a bit less effecient, will
track the alignment padding space to see if its too much
